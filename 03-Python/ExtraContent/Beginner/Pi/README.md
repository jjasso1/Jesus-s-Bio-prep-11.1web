# Calculate the value of Pi


## Instructions

* Calculate the approximate value of pi (using the following infinite series),

\pi = 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 ...


## Hint

* You can assume to approximate the value of the infinite series with the first 100,000 terms
* Try varying the number of terms and see how close or far the value of pi is to its actual value
