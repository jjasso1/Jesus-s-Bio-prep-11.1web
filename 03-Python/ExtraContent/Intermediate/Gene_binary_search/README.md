# Gene Search

Search for the [codons](https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/codon-155/#targetText=codon,proteins%20includes%2020%20amino%20acids) "GAT" and "ATC" in the gene sequence "AGGATCTACGAGCATTCATCGCGAGATTCCAC"

## Instructions

1. First find all 3-letter codons in the gene sequence and sort them

2. Search for the given codons "GAT" and "ATC" in the sorted list of codons (from step 1). Use [binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm#targetText=In%20computer%20science%2C%20binary%20search,middle%20element%20of%20the%20array.)
