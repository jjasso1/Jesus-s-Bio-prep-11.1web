# Wrestling with Functions

## Instructions

* Analyze the code and CSV provided, looking specifically for what needs to still be added to the application.

* Using the starter code provided, create a function called `print_percentages` which takes in a parameter called `wrestler_data` and does the following:

  * Uses the data stored within `wrestler_data` to calculate the percentage of matches the wrestler won, lost, and drew over the course of a year. (Here `wrestler_data` is a list containing one wrestler's data, i.e. the list corresponds to one row in the csv file)

  * Prints out the stats for the wrestler to the terminal.

## Note : 
The code for calling the function print_percentages with a single row in the csv file (matching the user's choice of wrestler) is already given to you

## Bonus

* Still within the `print_percentages()` function, create a conditional that checks a wrestler's loss percentage and prints either "Jobber" to the screen if the number was greater than fifty or "Superstar" if the number was less than 50.
